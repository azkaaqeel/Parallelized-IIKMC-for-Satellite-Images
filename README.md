# Parallelized IIkMC for Satellite Images

This project implements and benchmarks **Inter-Image k-Means Clustering (IIkMC)** on large-scale satellite imagery datasets, with support for CPU and memory-efficient parallelization. The approach is designed to scale to multi-scene Landsat data using both full-resolution and downsampled strategies.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Overview

- Cluster large satellite scenes into land-cover classes using a modified k-Means algorithm.
- Supports CPU-parallel execution using `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
- Memory-safe block-wise clustering avoids full Nxk matrix computation.
- Optional downsampling for faster convergence during development.
- Cluster maps visualized using matplotlib with geospatial mask reconstruction.
